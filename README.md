HealthNote---IBM-Watson
=======================

Utilizing IBM Watson DeepQA API for IBM competition.

Healthnote is what we have created and will be presenting to IBM. Here is the description of the technology portion:

=======================
What we want to do 

We want insight into aggregating all of the worlds emerging research findings, parse and analyze them intelligently to calculate the best answers to any medical questions backed by evidence, and spread this access of knowledge to everyone. 

Why is this a problem? 
     
The human memory system is fallible. It’s limited, restrained, unreliable, and unable to accurately retrieve information with 100% accuracy. 
 
To put in perspective on a neurological level, we only process 50 bits of information a second. Our brains are highly optimized for efficiency, meaning all sensory processing in the brain relies on pattern recognition and assumptions, leading to many cognitive biases in our logical reasonings.

1.8 zettrabytes (1.8 trillion GB’s of information) in 2011. Thats 57.5 billion 32GB iPads. * 30 for that in the next 10 years.  How can we hold even a tiny fraction of that data? 

How to Use Watson?
Watson’s hypothesis generation will become more and more accurate due to it’s feedback loop and evaluation.  Research come out every day. We provide the service to feed unstructured data into Watson to train. With every passing day, 

Unstructured data is 80% of everything out there. Doing some math, its 35 * .8 = 20 zettrabytes. 20 trillion gigabytes. (Insert large number here). Watson’s advanced natural language processing means sifting through that data won’t be a simple key value lookup. Watson takes into account context, evidence, and confidence levels. Thats the power of IBM watson. 

Dynamic learning, just like human evolution, Watson will grow with us. It will learn with us and coexist in this new ecosystem of human computer interaction. This symbiotic relationship will propel us into a powerful era of information. 

Taken out of context, big data loses its meaning may be Ethical or legal issues

Information must become easier to understand and act upon.
