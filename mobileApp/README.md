"Keeping clinicians up to date"
"Incorporate research-advances"

- Use cognitive computing to help answer patient questions for pre and post surgery.
- Reduce readmission costs, internal improvement to lessen doctor load. 

- Use cognitive computing to compute similarity between quesitons and doctor information. Send hospitals unstructured dataset of questions as well as organized questions and feedback for each doctor

Aim
- Find the most time intensive processess and what watson can bring to the table.
